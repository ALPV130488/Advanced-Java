(1)Exercise:Create a class called Vehicle. Create subclasses like Truck, Bus, Car etc. Add common methods 
in the base class and specific methods in the corresponding class. Create a class called Road 
and create objects for the Truck, Car, Bus etc and display the appropriate message. 


(2)Exercise:Create a class called Worker. Write classes DailyWorker and SalariedWorker that inherit from
Worker.Every worker has a name and a salary rate. Write method Pay (int hours) to compute 
the week pay of every worker.  A Daily worker is paid on the basis of the number of days 
she/he works.The salaried worker gets paid the wage for 40 hours a week no matter what the
actual hours are.  Test this program to calculate the pay of workers. 


(3)Exercise:Create a class called Shape3D with the following method signatures alone, volume () and 
surfaceArea (). Then create subclasses like Cylinder, Sphere, and Cubeetc and implement 
these methods.


(4)Exercise:Create the classes required to store data regarding different types of courses that employees
In a company can enroll for. All courses have name and course fee. Courses are also either 
classroom delivered or delivered online. Courses could also be full time or part time. The 
program must be menu based input which enables the course coordinator to register 
employees for courses, list out employees registered for specific courses, deregister employees 
from a course.

		Solution Guidance (if applicable):The output can be like this,
Enter the number of the choice you want to choose:
To register for a course
To deregister for a course
To list the courses offered
To list the employees registered for a specific course.

(5)Exercise:Create two interfaces namely Drawable and Fillable. Create class called Line, Circle, Square and
implement following methods through interface.

<I>Drawable ------ drawingColor(), thickness()
<I>Fillable ---------- fillingColor(), size()


(6)Exercise:Createa package called bank with the following Interfaces.

			<Interface> Account





<Interface>DepositAcc				<Interface>LoanAcc



			<Interface> Interest



	

<Interface>CreditInterest				<Interface>DebitInterest


<Interface> Account
Data members: Four String variables to hold the account type “Savings, Fixed,PersonalLoan,
HousingLoan”
Methods:  createAcc()

<Interface>DepositAcc
Methods:  withdraw (), deposit(),getBalance()

<Interface>LoanAcc
Methods:  repayPrincipal (),payInterest (),payPartialPrincipal ()

<Interface>Interest
Data members:  Four double variables to hold the interest percentage of Savings account, Fixed
deposit account,PersonalLoan account and HousingLoan account.
Methods:  calcInt()

<Interface>CreditInterest
Methods:  addMonthlyInt(),addHalfYrlyInt(),addAnnualInt()

<Interface>DebitInterest
Methods:  deductMonthlyInt(),deductHalfYrlyInt(),deductAnnualInt()


Create a package called BankImpl and create the following classes in it.

SavingsAcc which implements DepositAcc  and CreditInterest
FDAcc which implements DepositAcc  and CreditInterest
PersonalLoanAcc which implements LoanAcc and DebitInterest
HousingLoanAcc which implements LoanAcc and DebitInterest

Now create a class called MyAccount and create instances of all the accounts and generate appropriate output.
